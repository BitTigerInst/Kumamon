# 1st Project: [Web Crawler via Scrapy](http://bittiger.io/microproject/oYDSG6MSFihpiNJ66)

# Pacing
<<<<<<< HEAD
[2016/02/08 - 2016/02/14] First Stage: Create a Scrapy project to crawl the content in the Xiaomi Appstore homepage or any other Appstore homepage     
[2016/02/15 - 2016/02/21] Second Stage: Save the crawled content in MongoDB[2]. Install Python MongoDB driver and modify pipelines.py to insert crawled data into MongoDB.      
[2016/02/22 - 2016/02/29] Third Stage: Crawl more content by following next page links. So far you have likely only crawled the content of the home page. We need to use Splash[3] and ScrapyJS[4] to re-render the web page to transform the dynamic part to static content if the next page link is written in JavaScript    

# What is next?
1. 1st project - Crawler (python)  
2. 2nd project - Recommender (python / spark)  
3. 3rd project - website (Meteor/React)   

> ### Learn programing via project
> Nowadays we spend a lot of time to have a good grap of the Data Structure and Algorithms by solving the problems on CC, LC and GFG.
> But we still probably cannot end up with a good result in our job seeking, since the CS job market is so hot that you have so many competitors...
> 
> Quality beats quantity. Instead of going through a lot of questions, if you can make best use of your knowledge to build a product, 
> you can easily extend to similar problems after some practice(this is what they look for, Your problem solving abilities).
