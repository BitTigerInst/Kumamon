# Learn programing via project
Nowadays we spend a lot of time to have a good grap of the Data Structure and Algorithms by solving the problems on CC, LC and GFG.
But we still probably cannot end up with a good result in our job seeking, since the CS job market is so hot that you have so many competitors...

Quality beats quantity. Instead of going through a lot of questions, if you can make best use of your knowledge to build a product, you can easily extend to similar problems after some practice(this is what they look for, Your problem solving abilities).

# Plan 
BitTiger has already released bunch of good projects since Dec 2015. We can follow the instruction from the video to build our own products. 

[2016/02/08 - 2016/02/14] Project Selection, Plan Discussion, and Proposal Draft Writing  
[2016/02/15 - 2016/02/29] System Design, Resource Discovery, Project Implementation, Document Writing  
[2016/03/01 - 2016/03/07] User Manual Writing and Video Presentation Making  
> Details of each schedule and task will be added later.

# Resource
Check the shared documents in our private slack channel.  
The projects interesting to me are listed below  
1. AppStore - Crawler (python)
2. AppStore - Recommender (python / spark)
3. AppStore - website (Meteor/React)

> other language is welcomed here!

# MileStone
* Minimalism, we should at least implements those modules without further improvement. (simple, clean and concise)
* Later, implement our creative ideas based on the basic modules.
* Additionally, work should be focus on scalibility, robustness and response speed.

# requirement
* Every piece of code should be transparent upon first reading.
* Easy extensibility.
